# SolarSystem
Scale* model of the solar system

*the distances are to scale, but the size of the planets are only scale relative to eachother. However, the code has been written such that everything is scale. 
A variable 'sizeGenerosity' has been added to increase the size of all planets, otherwise they would not be able to be seen.
